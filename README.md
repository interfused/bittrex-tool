Basic rudimentary tool for trading. This is not stylized as it is meant to be run via a cron job.  However, the data can be viewed.  This is extremely rough and is currently under development.

To do:
- Stylize.  This is hideous
- account creation
- login feature with ability to set API key detail from 
- database connect capture daily cron job data calculating EMA, SMA, & Bollinger bands
